This web based Mancala game supports a human vs human and human vs AI mode . It is  powered by HTML and CSS for the front end and JavaScript for the backend .

The AI is implemented using the minimax algorithm and alpha beta prunnining.

Currently, the GUI has a caption feature that prints the number of stones in the pots. We focused on building the backedn for this stage of development and would like to further improve the GUI component by adding realistic abimations and marble figures.
